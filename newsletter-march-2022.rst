Read the Docs newsletter - March 2022
=====================================

It's been pretty quiet on the company front in February,
with nothing much to report.
**We're actively working on our latest job description,
which will be a product-focused Python development position.**
If you're interested, please `let us know`_.

New features
------------

In February we continued to work on refactors and internal changes.
Among the major user-facing changes:

- **We now have the CDN on Read the Docs for Business in beta**, with a couple accounts testing it. If you're interested, please `contact us`_.
- You can now `cancel builds <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8850>`_ via a button in the dashboard. This will save resources, and allow you to ensure that you don't hit concurrency limits if you trigger a few builds at once.
- Projects that are imported via the API are now required to have a VCS repository linked to them, if your organization has `VCS SSO <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commercial/single-sign-on.html#sso-with-vcs-provider-github-bitbucket-or-gitlab>`_ turned on, so that users will be able to access it.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs
Changelog <readthedocs:changelog>`.

Upcoming features
-----------------

- **We're working on pre and post-build steps**, and hope to have those released in the next week or two. This is a long-requested feature that we're really excited to be able to share with folks.
- We're getting much closer on our landing page update. They are being served from a super secret URL, and will be made our official front page before long...
- We continue to work on tracking 404 pages in our project analytics,
  so that projects can easily fix up missing or outdated page links.
- We have `made process on support <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8811>`_ for multiple projects in a single git repo.

Possible issues
---------------

* We are still watching Sphinx upgrades for possible issues they might cause around the ecosystem.
* We are also tracking the upcoming :doc:`/github-git-protocol-deprecation` to ensure that it will have minimal impact for our users.
