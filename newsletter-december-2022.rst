Read the Docs newsletter - December 2022
========================================

Here are the first features and updates that have hatched since we announced a Q4 focus on core platform features in the :doc:`previous newsletter </newsletter-december-2022>`.


New features
------------

The latest updates from our team:

- Sphinx 6 support?
- sphinx-theme-rtd 1.2.0?
- Build skipping via command https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/9649

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs Changelog <readthedocs:changelog>`.


Upcoming features
-----------------

(from last newsletter)

- A 1.2.0 release of :ref:`sphinx-rtd-theme <sphinx_rtd_theme110_upcoming_releases>` will support docutils 0.18 and Sphinx 6.
- We're working on improving our integration with Material for MkDocs, which is a great theme for MkDocs documentation projects.
- Many improvements to our URL handling code, which will allow us to support more flexible URL configurations for projects.
- A search redesign to make it nicer across our dashboard and in-doc search experiences. 
- 404 pages are being improved by contextualization the user message, giving relevant guidance to readers and project owners.


Possible issues
---------------

If you find regressions in any new releases of the `sphinx-rtd-theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_,
please don't hesitate to `open an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/>`_.

We continue planning to be more active in deprecating old and outdated approaches to using our platform in Q4.
We don't have anything firm to announce here yet,
but we do plan to be more active in removing these features in the coming months.
