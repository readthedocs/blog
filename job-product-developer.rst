About the job
-------------

Our company is quite small,
so this job will require doing many different things.
You will join our team that is focused on building and growing our various Read the Docs products.
This means you will work to help us figure out what features to build,
work with the team to build those features,
and then figure out how to explain them to our users.

Each day will be a bit different, but some of the tasks that we might ask you to do are:

* Create design documents that argue for both the business & technical benefits of features.
* Implement features in our `Python & Django web app <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/tree/master/readthedocs>`_.
* Review code that other members of our team has written, as well as contributors to our open source projects, in a respectful manner.
* Engage with customers via email support, offering helpful suggestions or explaining tradeoffs in our product.
* Write docs and blog posts for some of the work that you've done.
* Assist with weekly releases by monitoring, testing, and debugging our application.
* Create a landing page that explains how our product is great for a specific set of users (eg. data scientists, Python developers, SaaS product docs, etc.)

We don't expect you to be experienced in doing all these tasks,
but hope for someone who is excited to learn how to do them.
If you're really great at 1-2 of them,
that's a great starting point for this role.

Who would be a good fit?
------------------------

Any of these people would be a good fit:

* Someone who has built, documented, and blogged about a feature in an open source project
* Someone who has advocated for a new feature being built at their current company, and then built it
* Someone who has worked to get a feature that they built used by more people via a blog post and improved docs
* Anyone who has used Read the Docs, and could tell us why they would build a new feature in the product
* Someone who has contributed to Sphinx development, or has built and maintained a Sphinx extension

The thing we want is to work with skilled people who are excited to work on our product.
If that's you,
please apply below!
