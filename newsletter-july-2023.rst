Read the Docs newsletter - July 2023
====================================

News and updates
----------------

- ✅️ New feature
- 🐛️ Bug fix
- 🔒️ Security update

Upcoming features
-----------------

.. Skipped in May and June:

- 🚢️ We have concluded work on the first phase of our new `readthedocs-client <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-client>`_.
  The client will be a single library for all the ways Read the Docs enhances documentation from having a flyout menu
  to link to other versions, translations, or subprojects, to showing version warnings for folks browsing outdated docs
  to running ads on community projects.
  There will be integration points and APIs to customize all of these features in the new client.

  We will start to use it on a few selected projects.
  If you are interested in having it enabled on your project,
  please `reach out`_.

Possible issues
---------------

- ⚠️ Please make sure to read the blog post: :doc:`/migrate-configuration-v2`.

  If you didn't have a ``.readthedocs.yaml`` configuration file,
  and you are introducing one for the first time,
  we're excited for you to be able to use all our new features like specifying build tool versions (Node, Rust, etc.)!
  
  The blog post offers help with that 💡️

Awesome project of the month
----------------------------

We might remove this or make less efforts, so there might not be a thread.
