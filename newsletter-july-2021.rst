Read the Docs newsletter - July 2021
====================================

Welcome to a new edition of our monthly newsletter, where we
share the most relevant updates around Read the Docs,
offer a summary of new features we shipped
during the previous month,
and share what we'll be focusing on in the near future.

Company highlights
------------------

- Eric_ presented the history of the company at the Upstream 2021 conference
  along with ideas for open source sustainability.
  You can read more about it in :doc:`our recent blog post </behind-the-scenes-2021-1>`.
- We revamped our `sustainability page <https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/>`_
  to clarify the ways in which you or your project can go ad-free.
- The first two parts of the Sphinx tutorial we are writing
  in the context of the :doc:`CZI grant </czi-grant-announcement>`
  were merged to the development branch,
  and will be publicly available soon in the official Sphinx documentation.
- We finalized the design of our upcoming
  `Embed API v3 <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/design/embed-api.html>`_,
  which will open up more possibilities of embedding content inside and outside Read the Docs.
  Watch this space for updates on the topic.
- One extra person will join our team as Frontend Developer.
  More details coming soon!

New features
------------

- We added a new functionality to rebuild a specific PR build.
  A small user experience improvement that we hope is useful to many of our users
  (see image below).
- We added a JSON schema of our configuration file to
  `JSON Schema Store <https://www.schemastore.org/json/>`_.
  If your editor has support for JSON schema,
  it will now give you autocompletion and linting for
  `our .readthedocs.yml <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html>`_.

  and start working on an introductory tutorial for Read the Docs.

  and will continue working on it for the coming weeks,

Possible issues
---------------

Our release from June 15th contains `a security advisory to our CSRF
settings <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-3v5m-qmm9-3c6c>`_.

On an unrelated note, we are receiving more support requests from our users
about some software versions in our Docker images,
and we have decided to give that work more priority.
