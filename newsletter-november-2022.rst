      Company updates and new features from the last month,
      current focus, and upcoming features.

Read the Docs newsletter - November 2022
========================================

A bunch of new features and updates have emerged since we announced a Q4 focus on core platform features in the :doc:`previous newsletter <newsletter-october-2022>`.


New features
------------

The latest updates from our team:

- :doc:`sphinx-rtd-theme 1.1.0 <theme-release-110>` has been released.
- After rolling out auto-cancelling builds `last month <https://blog.readthedocs.com/cancel-old-builds/>`_, we have alread recorded a whopping 10% decrease in builds.
  We're really happy with how this turned out, not least that it effectively reduces our cloud footprint by 10% ðŸŒ±.
- We started incrementally refactoring our own documentation to match the `DiÃ¡taxis framework <https://diataxis.fr/>`_. We will be writing more about this, as we are currently gaining practical experience.
- Much thanks to `AA-Turner <https://github.com/AA-Turner>`_ and the Sphinx community for working together on a proposal and releasing the extension `sphinxcontrib-jquery <http://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-jquery>`_ which themes and extensions that need jQuery will have to add as a dependency once Sphinx 6 is released.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs Changelog <readthedocs:changelog>`.

Upcoming features
-----------------

- We're working on improving our integration with Material for MkDocs, which is a great theme for MkDocs documentation projects.
- Many improvements to our URL handling code, which will allow us to support more flexible URL configurations for projects.
- A search redesign to make it nicer across our dashboard and in-doc search experiences. 
- 404 page contextualization


Possible issues
---------------

We continue planning to be more active in deprecating old and outdated approaches to using our platform in Q4.
We don't have anything firm to announce here yet,
but we do plan to be more active in removing these features in the coming months.
