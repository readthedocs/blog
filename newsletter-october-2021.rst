Read the Docs newsletter - October 2021
=======================================

Welcome to the latest edition of our monthly newsletter, where we
share the most relevant updates around Read the Docs,
offer a summary of new features we shipped
during the previous month,
and share what we'll be focusing on in the near future.

Company highlights
------------------

- We have resumed sending our blog updates by email.
  You can `subscribe to our newsletter <https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/p8b7z2>`_
  so you don't miss them.
- Version 3 of our Embed API is now implemented,
  thanks to :doc:`the CZI grant we received</czi-grant-announcement>`.
  We will give more details about it soon.
- We have reworked :doc:`our team page <readthedocs:team>`
  to give you a better idea of who we are and how we work at the company.

New features
------------

- You can now use :ref:`our newer build specification <readthedocs:config-file/v2:build (beta specification)>`
  that leverages a newer image based on Ubuntu 20.04
  and gives more control over the versions of
  Python, Node.js, Rust, and Go.
  Projects like `pypa/cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/6330>`_
  and `thebe <https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/pull/472>`_
  are already using it,
  and we will make an announcement with more information soon.
- We have added a new section to our Dashboard that exposes user security logs.

   Security logs

- We have added a button on the Analytics section to download all your data,
  so you are not limited by the last 30 days that we show.
- We have revamped our onboarding process.
  If you are new to Read the Docs, you can now
  `fork our template repository <https://github.com/readthedocs/tutorial-template>`_
  and follow :doc:`our tutorial <readthedocs:tutorial/index>`
  to learn how to use the platform.
  We plan to keep expanding the tutorial during the coming weeks.
- We have made :doc:`our how-to guides <readthedocs:guides/index>` more visible
  and simplified its categorization, in addition to other documentation improvements.

Thanks to our external contributors `Mozi`_ and `Dmitry`_.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs

Possible issues
---------------

We are detecting an increasing number of spammy projects on our platform.
While this rarely affects legitimate users, it is still a concern to us
and we are planning to take measures to tackle it.

In addition, some projects experienced networking issues due to
`the expiration of Let's Encrypt root certificate <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8555>`_.
We deployed a fix shortly after the problem was reported.
