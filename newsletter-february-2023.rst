Upcoming features

  Notes:

  Next newsletter:
  Make a general announcement of our Roadmap

  General:

  When creating newsletter drafts, we keep the items here from the previous newsletter.
  This is in order to ensure due follow-up on features that are announced publicly.
  
  Feature done? A great follow-up is to add what was previously an upcoming feature as a released feature in the former section.
  
  Feature not done?
  Make sure that upcoming features are announced with a link to issues or PRs where the progress can be seen.
  If this is done, then subsequent newsletters aren't compelled to share progress when it's uninteresting.
  
  If a feature was announced as upcoming but isn't yet released,
  then try rephrasing the announcement as a general news update about the progress and where it can be followed.
