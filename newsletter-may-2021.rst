      Company updates and new features from last month,
      current focus, and upcoming features from May.

Read the Docs newsletter - May 2021
===================================

Welcome to a new edition of our monthly newsletter, where we
openly share the most relevant updates around Read the Docs,
offer a summary of new features we shipped
during the previous month,
and share what we'll be focusing on in the near future.

Company highlights
------------------

-  The team keeps growing! `Ra`_ will join us next week
   to do account management for EthicalAds.
-  We reworked our deploy procedure to almost remove the need to interrupt builds.
   Therefore, you should see less build retries during our deploy timeframe,
   normally Tuesday morning Pacific time.
-  After some careful deliberation,
   we started the process to `deprecate recommonmark in favor of
   MyST <https://github.com/readthedocs/recommonmark/issues/221>`_,
   a better maintained alternative.
   We are excited to see that
   some projects have already migrated without effort,
   and we are looking forward to helping MyST-Parser thrive!
   Thanks to the Executable Books Project folks for creating this project.
-  Our `frontend developer position <https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/>`_ is still open!
   We are actively looking for candidates,
   if you know people that could potentially be interested
   feel free to forward them the link above.

New features
------------

-  We improved several areas of our contributor documentation:
   `we added more detailed steps on how to contribute to our
   docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/docs.html>`_
   (both from the GitHub UI and from your own computer),
   and we expanded our `development installation
   guide <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/install.html>`_
   with more clear instructions for static assets
   and some extra verification procedures.
   Thanks `Coco <https://github.com/cocobennett>`_ for this contribution!
-  We rolled up `a new keyword detection algorithm in our ad
   client <https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client/pull/48>`_,
   which should make the ads you see more meaningful and useful.
-  We are about to disable Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)
   on our dashboard as well as on documentation sites
   because of `privacy concerns <https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea>`_.
   On Read the Docs and EthicalAds, we maintain our commitment
   to avoid user-targeted advertisement,
   and `use only contextual targeting
   instead <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/advertising-details.html#our-targeting-details>`_.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our `Read the Docs
Changelog <https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/changelog.html>`_ and `Ethical Ad Server
Changelog <https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/page/developer/changelog.html>`_.

Current focus & known issues
----------------------------

-  We are working with the Sphinx maintainers
   to help testing the upcoming Sphinx 4.0.0 release
   and decrease the risk of breakage.
   It is an ongoing effort that requires
   finding a balance between stability and maintainability,
   and we hope we can do the best for our users and the Sphinx community.
   Read `the release notes <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html>`_
   to check for any breaking changes,
   and if in doubt, pin your declared dependency to ``<4``.
-  Cloudflare has changed how their SSL works,
   so we're figuring out how that might impact users of custom domains on our Community site.
   It will likely only impact projects that are proxying to us,
   not domains that follow our `recommended custom domain
   configuration <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_domains.html#custom-domain-support>`_.

Upcoming features
-----------------

-  `Anthony`_ will keep working on releasing `sphinx_rtd_theme` 1.0,
   start getting users to test our new user interface,
   and iron out our Data Processing Agreements.
-  On the EthicalAds side, `David`_ will be improving
   the KPI reporting for our publishers,
   and onboarding `Ra`_ on the team along with `Eric`_.
-  `Eric`_ is focused on onboarding our new hire on the EthicalAds team,
   finishing a CZI grant proposal for funding in 2021-2022,
   and figuring out how the team can handle growing from 5 to 8 folks in 2021!
-  `Juan Luis`_ will work with `Eric`_ on the new CZI proposal,
   continue discussing with the Sphinx community about `the new
   tutorial <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9165>`_,
   and have more Customer Development calls with existing users.
-  `Manuel`_ will continue improving our operations and deployment procedures,
   make single sign-on discoverable by users,
   and release a new version of `sphinx-hoverxref <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-hoverxref/>`_
   compatible with newer versions of Sphinx and MathJax.
-  And finally, `Santos`_ will wrap up our new infrastructure and configuration changes
   allowing users to install custom `apt` packages.
