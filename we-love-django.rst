      Read the Docs has a special relationship with Django.

Read the Docs ❤️s Django
========================

tldr;

* The Django Community has done a tremendous amount of progressive work **for documentation**
* Read the Docs wouldn't exist if it wasn't for The Django Web Framework

Django and Documentation
------------------------

We believe that one of the reasons why technical documentation has evolved so much in the past decade,
is the visionary efforts by the Django community,
seeing the documentation in itself as a reason for choosing the product.

What Django did for documentation over a decade ago is one of the factors that inspired us to start Read the Docs.

`The Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_ is hosted on Read the Docs,
and we are very glad to see a flagship documentation project be.

(...) [Write the Docs??]
Therefore, it doesn't surprise us that the Django community is continuing to evolve technical documentation through Daniele Procida's visionary work on the Diátaxis Framework. We'll be covering this in an upcoming post.


Participating in a community is a win!
--------------------------------------

The Read the Docs core team takes part in local communities, conference organizing and Open Source contribution.
What we gain from this makes it worth everything.

I means a lot to our skill building and both professional and social networks.


Bronze Membership of DSF
------------------------

We've enlisted as a bronze member of Django Software Foundation,
which is one of the ways for companies to help DSF.

`Corporate Membership`_ is an important way for organizations that rely on Django
to ensure its sustainability and future,
and we hope that more will follow.
The DSF funds the Fellowship Program,
one of the fundamental structures that gives us regular Django releases and assures a high quality.

**A big thank you to DSF**
