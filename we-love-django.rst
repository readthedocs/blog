      Read the Docs has a special relationship with Django.

Read the Docs ‚ù§Ô∏è Django
========================

tldr;

* The Django Community has done a tremendous amount of progressive work **for documentation projects everywhere**.
* Read the Docs wouldn't exist if it wasn't for The Django Web Framework.
* We continue to benefit from a relationship with Django and its community.

Django and Documentation
------------------------

One of the reasons why technical documentation has evolved so much in the past decade,
is the visionary efforts by the Django community,
seeing the documentation in itself as a reason for choosing the product.

It's easy to observe that *the documentation* is a reason to choose Django,
since using such a framework means using its documentation.
Such a framework does not simply consist of code and features,
it's *just as much* the documentation üíØÔ∏è

We've always had the impression that many people in our network are fans of Django's documentation,
and we understand how important it is to have good documentation for your main web framework:
we use the documentation daily.
The core team of Read the Docs all agreed that when we are working on Django projects,
we use the documentation at least once in a day [1]_.

*What Django did for documentation over a decade ago is one of the factors that inspired us to start Read the Docs.*

.. [1] One core team member has started to use Python type hints extensively and reduced the need for online documentation lookups in general üí°Ô∏è

Innovations in documentation
----------------------------

`The Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`__ is built in an innovative way,
integrating documentation deeply into the core of the project.
Django's documentation is...

* a core element in the workflow of Django contributors: new software features and changes always arrive together with documentation.
* versioned together with Django: you can always find a version of the documentation that matches the version of Django that you are running.
* part of the software code.
* built directly into the `djangoproject.com <https://djangoproject.com>`__ website.

Therefore, it doesn't surprise us that the Django community is continuing to evolve technical documentation through Daniele Procida's visionary work on the Di√°taxis Framework.
We'll be covering this in an upcoming post.

Participating in a community is a win!
--------------------------------------

Everyone in the Read the Docs core team takes part in local communities, conference organizing, and Open Source contribution.
What we gain from this makes it worth everything.

It means a lot to our skill building and both professional and social networks.
The community that we are generally most active in is the Django community,
where we gain skills not just in Django,
but in web development in general and the art and craft of Python coding.

As many others,
we love the Django community for its focus on inclusion and diversity.
As practitioners of documentation,
we meet these goals on a daily basis:
If documentation isn't inclusive and respectful of diversity,
it's not good documentation.

Bronze Membership of DSF
------------------------

We've enlisted as a bronze member of Django Software Foundation,
which is one of the ways for companies to help DSF.

`Corporate Membership`_ is an important way for organizations that rely on Django
to ensure its sustainability and future,
and we hope that more will follow.
The DSF funds the Fellowship Program,
one of the fundamental structures that gives us regular Django releases and assures a high quality.

**A big thank you to DSF for their work and dedication to Django and the community!**
