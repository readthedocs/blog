Read the Docs newsletter - January 2024
========================================

News and updates
----------------

* We have shipped :doc:`new-improvements-to-redirects`, making our redirects much more powerful and flexible. 
* We have shipped a `v1 of an updated approach to notifications <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/10922>`_. Currently there won't be much UX difference, but as we move forward with this project, we will be able to provide more context and control to users.
* We continue to work on improving Addons, our new approach to documentation integrations. New documentation and bug fixing continues to happen.
* We shipped version 2.0 of our `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which drops support for many old versions of Sphinx and Python.

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs Changelog <readthedocs:changelog>`.

Upcoming changes
----------------

* Addons will be made more configurable in our new beta dashboard, starting a trend of moving away from the old dashboard for new features.
* Our `beta dashboard <https://beta.readthedocs.org/dashboard/>`_ continues to be tested in public beta, and new functionality for Addons configuration will only be available in that new interface.
* We continue to work on some business model changes enabled by the new redirects work, including allowing access to Forced Redirects for more users.

Possible issues
---------------

* Users need to update their webhooks before **January 31, 2024** if they are configured without a secret. All users who need to take action should have received email and site notifications about this. 
* We are discussing removing support for all VCS systems except Git, as our userbase is heavily biased towards Git users and it will simplify maintenance and development of features. We stopped developing features for Mercurial, Subversion, and Bazaar years ago, and we are considering removing support for them entirely. We will be reaching out to these users to get feedback on this change.
