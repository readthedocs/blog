Read the Docs newsletter - September 2021
=========================================

Welcome to the latest edition of our monthly newsletter, where we
share the most relevant updates around Read the Docs,
offer a summary of new features we shipped
during the previous month,
and share what we'll be focusing on in the near future.

Company highlights
------------------

- We have published
  :doc:`the first release candidate of version 1.0.0 of our Sphinx theme </theme-release-100rc1>`,
  which adds support for recent versions of Sphinx and docutils among other things,
  and announced our future plans for it.
  Check out the linked blog post to know more.
  **Update**: We have released 1.0 to PyPI
- The :doc:`first part of the new Read the Docs tutorial <readthedocs:tutorial/index>`,
  which we wrote as part of :doc:`our CZI grant </czi-grant-announcement>`, is online!
  We hope that it serves as a better starting point for people seeking to learn how to use our platform.

New features
------------

- Commercial users can now `share specific versions of their
  projects <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commercial/sharing.html>`_
  and `log out from the flyout
  menu <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html#logging-out>`_.
- We added the possibility for users to `remove themselves from a
  project <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8384>`_
  without having to ask an owner to remove them
  (as long as they are not the only owner of the project).
- We fixed `a small usability issue with our search-as-you-type
  box <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-sphinx-search/pull/93>`_,
  that ignored the first typed characters under certain circumstances.
- We have documented our `unofficial support for
  Gitea <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8402>`_,
  and made other minor documentation fixes.

Thanks to our external contributors `Mozi`_, `Maksudul Haque`_,
`Stefano Costa`_, and `Christian Clauss`_.

Changelog <https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/changelog.html>`_.

Possible issues
---------------

We have been `making changes to how we store cookies <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8304>`_
to make our site more secure.
This has caused some minor issues in certain web browsers
or to `users that were embedding private documentation pages inside an
iframe <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8422>`_.
