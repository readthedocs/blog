Read the Docs newsletter - March 2023
========================================

News and updates
----------------

Here are the latest updates from our team since the :doc:`previous newsletter </newsletter-february-2023>`:

- TBD

You can always see the latest changes to our platforms in our :doc:`Read the Docs Changelog <readthedocs:changelog>`.


Upcoming features
-----------------

..
  Notes:

  Next newsletter:
  Make a general announcement of our Roadmap

  General:

  When creating newsletter drafts, we keep the items here from the previous newsletter.
  This is in order to ensure due follow-up on features that are announced publicly.
  
  Feature done? A great follow-up is to add what was previously an upcoming feature as a released feature in the former section.
  
  Feature not done?
  Make sure that upcoming features are announced with a link to issues or PRs where the progress can be seen.
  If this is done, then subsequent newsletters aren't compelled to share progress when it's uninteresting.
  
  If a feature was announced as upcoming but isn't yet released,
  then try rephrasing the announcement as a general news update about the progress and where it can be followed.

- More internal components of the build process will have a public API, giving full control and flexibility and allowing for more documentation tools to be used.
- Our Di√°taxis documentation refactor is entering final stages before the first reveal.

Possible issues
---------------

- üö¶Ô∏è There is a schedule maintenance window on Cloudflare that provides our CDN and SSL provisioning. 
  We are working to ensure that nothing is offline other than creation of new domains:

    On March 2nd, 2023, Cloudflare will be doing database maintenance that will impact SSL API availability and may result in certificate issuance delays.
Note: The date of the migration has shifted from February 14th to March 2nd. There are no additional changes (see below).
