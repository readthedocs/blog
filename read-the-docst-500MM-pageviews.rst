500MM Pageviews
===============

June 27th was an important day in the history of Read the Docs.

The **500 millionth page view** was served.

6/27/16.  This is the middle of the story.  
Let's go back to the beginning.

It was five years ago in a mad dash during a Django Dash (a 48 hour hackathon) that Read the Docs was born.  
Eric Holscher saw the importance of documentation, 
and knew there had to be a better automated way to improve the documentation process across languages and versions.  
A better way for open source projects to then instantly host the docs on a rock-solid hosting infrastructure.

Since then, it's become a juggernaut publisher of coding documentation.

*How big is half a billion?*

To help us better understand the scope and scale of 500 Million page views, 
we have to dive into the law of big numbers.

Let's start with some general assumptions:

* A page of code documentation is worth a dollar.  
Anyone who has ever productively written one line of code and benefited from good documentation knows this is pretty true.
If you're really in a bind and it saves your a$$, then it's worth it's weight in gold.

* 100,000,000 one dollar bills would get you to 6.79 miles, 
or the approximate height that commercial airlines fly when transporting you from a to b[#f1].

* Five times that height puts you halfway to the troposphere, or the lower atmosphere of planet Earth.  

We're halfway to the atmosphere if you traded a page every page of documenation served by Read the Docs for a dollar. 

* Don't like the money metaphor?  
Paper is thicker than money.  
A stack of 500 pages of old-school printed paper documentation that is outdated as soon as it's printed stands at 2 inches.  
The current mountain of paper that Read the Docs climbed is *31.56 miles* tall.  

You'd get pretty tired climbing that mountain.  
Everest is only 5 miles tall compared to all of the paper that wasn't used articulating the size and scope of our milestone.  
Run a 50K ultra-marathon vertically and you are just about there.

The weird math of open source is that unlike VC-funded and capitalized companies, 
billionaires aren't made from these :doc:`herculean <read-the-docs-2015-stats>` accomplishments.  
A lot of work is created, 
and anyone who has operated enterprises with hundreds of millions of pageviews understand the dev and ops requirements, 
which frequently includes scores of people and big budgets.

Read the Docs has done this with a team of a core team of no more than two, 
including Eric and Anthony, 
the co-founders, 
plus our brave and :doc:`valued contributors <https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors>`
who **bravely and boldly** continue to operate the service today.


Today you can tip the math in favor of open source and more great documentation and better code.

you.
Gold medalists sleep better at night.

* Closed source, 
private and public enterprises are invited to 
participate in the Read the Docs revenue program, 
which benefits the growth of Read the Docs to a billion pages of documentation viewed.

* Invest brain time instead of funny green paper from your wallet and read Roads and Bridges: :doc:`The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure <http://readthedocs.org/sustainability/click/12/RGLMBScQnZcb/>` by Nadia Eghbal.  
Society runs on open source software that is buckling under the demand.  

* Invest `your time <http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html?>` 
and get involved in open source by contributing to the project.
